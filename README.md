# Kinect-IoT-Gesture-Interface
Kinect Based Gesture control for the IoT. No more faffing with apps, just point and interact.

Simply point at and 'grip' the IoT devices around you room then you can interact with them by moving your fist around.

You can interact with multiple devices simultaneously as well as multiple people.

See us present in the finals of Hack Cambridge for more details of how it works... https://youtu.be/eZp1qSF06uM?t=353
